# **Projects**

Below are the linked portfolio projects I completed during this semester. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **0: Overview of NLP**
A report that provides a brief overview of NLP and why I am interested in this field. 

*Read the [report here](Portfolios/Overview_of_NLP.pdf)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **1. NLP Preprocessing**
This program implements basic preprocessing to an input text file. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate common preprocessing techniques used in NLP projects, such as capitalization and standardization of phone numbers and ids to a specific format. Additionally, user input is used to correct invalid/incorrectly formatted text. File pickling is also showcased in this project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **2. Word Guessing Game**
This program's purpose is to showcase some basic functionality of the popular NLP library, nltk. After 
preprocessing a raw input text file, an interactive guessing game is implemented for a user to play. 
Follow the readme for this project for instructions on how to play the guessing game and more information
in the links below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **3. Exploring WordNet**
WordNet is a powerful tool in NLP. The purpose of this notebook is to introduce WordNet using nltk. 
The notebook covers concepts such as synsets, how nouns and verbs are organized, senti-synsets, collocations, and similairty metrics used in WordNet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **4. Ngrams Model**
This project constructs bigram and unigram dictionaries for 3 different languages, English, Italian, and French. Then, we calcuate probabilities for each language and compare against true labels with a test dataset.
The purpose of this project is to gain experience creating ngrams from text, build a language model from ngrams, and reflect on the utility of ngram language models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **5. Sentence Parsing**
Sentence parsing helps understand parts of speech and syntactical structure, which is integral to NLP. 
This document highlights the concepts related to sentence syntax, the 3 types of sentence parsing
techniques: PSG, dependency, and SRL, and how to use sentence parsers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **6. Dallas Mavs Players Web Crawler**
This project involves web scraping using beautifulsoup. It scrapes information about the players on the 
Dallas Mavericks NBA team and stores the scraped data into a knowledge base that us used in project 10: [Champ, a Dallas Mavericks Chatbot](Portfolios/Portfolio9/)

*[Report](Portfolios/Portfolio6/web_crawler_report.pdf)* | *[Code](Portfolios/Portfolio6/main.py)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **7. Classifying Fraud and Spam Emails**
This project involves using machine learning to classify email messages as fraud, commerical spam, 
phishing, or false positives. I tested and analyzed 3 algorithms: naive bayes, logistic regression, and a neural network for this multinomial classification problem. Text processing and vectorization techniques are also used in this project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **8. ACL Paper Summary**
This report summarizes and discusses the importance of an academic research paper featured at the
Long Paper Proceedings of the 2022 ACL (Association of Computational Linguistics) conference. 

*Read the [report here](Portfolios/Portfolio8/acl_paper_summary.pdf)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **9. Champ, a Dallas Mavericks Chatbot**
Created a chatbot, named "Champ" that answers questions from a user about the players on the Dallas Mavericks
NBA team. It is a command line bot that leverages NLP techniques and is able to carry a conversation with 
a user. Refer to the README for instructions on how to run and the report for sample dialog and analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **10. Classifying Fraud and Spam Emails using Deep Learning**
This project involves using machine learning to classify email messages as fraud, commerical spam, 
phishing, or false positives. I tested and analyzed 3 algorithms: simple sequential model, RNN, and a CNN for this multinomial classification problem. Text processing and vectorization techniques are also used in this project.
