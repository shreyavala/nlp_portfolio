# Champ, a Dallas Mavs Chatbot
A chatbot to query information about Dallas Mavericks players, written by Shreya Valaboju and Soham Mukherjee. Ask it anything about the Mavericks and its roster of players!

## What This Is
This is Champ, a bot and representation of the mascot of the Mavs, who is here to provide information about the best basketball team in the world. A one-stop-shop that can dynamically process queries from users, it will also make a profile for new users and store their likes/dislikes, which can be updated each time the bot starts up. 

## How to Use
Simply run the program as-is by executing the following command (ensure you have the necessary libraries installed AND chatbot.py and the data folder are in the same directory):

    $ python chatbot.py

Once logged in with likes/dislikes, you can ask Champ anything or something specific about a player from the 2022/2023 Roster. This includes:
	
0. Justin Holiday

You can ask Champ things like: 

    'What is Kyrie Irving's height?' 	

    'tell me about Luka Doncic's NBA draft' 	

    'Where did Javale go to college?'

and more! Refer to the report for more sample dialog. Keep an eye peeled for easter eggs ðŸ˜‰
