# Natural Language Processing Portfolio

#### *Author: Shreya Valaboju*
#### *Course/Section: CS 4395.001*


Portfolio for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. Showcases the projects done throughout the semester.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 0: Overview of NLP
A report that provides a brief overview of NLP and why I am interested in this field. 


*Read the [report here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 1: NLP Preprocessing
This program implements basic preprocessing to an input text file. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate common preprocessing techniques used in NLP projects, such as capitalization and standardization of phone numbers and ids to a specific format. Additionally, user input is used to correct invalid/incorrectly formatted text. File pickling is also showcased in this project. 

*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 1](Portfolio1) containing the code, an overview document with execution instructions, and data used in this project*

*[Code](Portfolio1/main.py)*

*[Data](Portfolio1/data/data.csv)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 2: Word Guessing Game
This program's purpose is to showcase some basic functionality of the popular NLP library, nltk. After 
preprocessing a raw input text file, an interactive guessing game is implemented for a user to play. 
Follow the readme for this project for instructions on how to play the guessing game and more information
in the links below. 


*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 2](Portfolio2) containing the code, an overview document with execution instructions, and data used in this project*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 3: Exploring WordNet
WordNet is a powerful tool in NLP. The purpose of this notebook is to introduce WordNet using nltk. 
The notebook covers concepts such as synsets, how nouns and verbs are organized, senti-synsets, collocations, and similairty metrics used in WordNet.

*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 3](Portfolio3) containing the notebook and an overview document with execution instructions*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 4: Ngrams Model
This project constructs bigram and unigram dictionaries for 3 different languages, English, Italian, and French. Then, we calcuate probabilities for each language and compare against true labels with a test dataset.
The purpose of this project is to gain experience creating ngrams from text, build a language model from ngrams, and reflect on the utility of ngram language models. 


*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 4](Portfolio4) containing the code, the data used, a narrative, and a readme with execution instruction and description*


*[Narrative](Portfolio4/portfolio4_cs4395.001_narrative.pdf)*

*[Program 1](Portfolio4/program1.py)*

*[Program 2](Portfolio4/program2.py)*

*[Data](Portfolio4/data/)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 5: Sentence Parsing
Sentence parsing helps understand parts of speech and syntactical structure, which is integral to NLP. 
This document highlights the concepts related to sentence syntax, the 3 types of sentence parsing
techniques: PSG, dependency, and SRL, and how to use sentence parsers. 

*Read the document [Sentence Parsing here](Portfolio5/sentence_parsing_portfolio5.pdf)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 6: Web Crawler
This project involves web scraping using beautifulsoup. It scrapes information about the players on the 
Dallas Mavericks NBA team and stores the scraped data into a knowledge base that is going to be used to 
develop a chatbot. 

*Read the [Web Crawler report here](Portfolio6/web_crawler_report.pdf)*

*[Code](Portfolio6/main.py)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 7: Text Classification
This project involves using machine learning to classify email messages as fraud, commerical spam, 
phishing, or false positives. We test and analyze 3 algorithms: naive bayes, logistic regression, and a neural network for this multi-class classification problem. Text processing and vectorization techniques are also used in this project.
