## **What is this portfolio?**
This is a portfolio for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. It showcases the projects done throughout the semester. I completed 10 projects that highlight different aspects of NLP, ranging from preprocessing and exploring popular libraries, like nltk or wordnet, to building a chatbot and deep learning models. For some projects, I collaborated with another teammate, and their information is mentioned as well.

## **A bit about myself**
My name is Shreya Valaboju. I am a graduating senior at the University of Texas at Dallas. This past semester, I decided to take the course, "Human Language Technolgies," which is fancy name for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Through various internships and projects, I have a good amount of experience with machine learning. I've made NLP models before, but I wanted to dig deeper into the concepts. Some takeaways from this course include:

* Fundamentals and usages of WordNet
* Building Deep Learning Learning Models using text data
* How to web scrape using beautifulsoup
* Sentence parsing types and techniques
* Real world applications and growth of NLP
  
From taking this course, my skills far exceed preprocessing text data. I am able to leverage various libraries, such as nltk, wordnet, beautifulsoup, to build projects like chatbots or deep learning models. I hope to continue to work on future NLP projects as well. For instance, I want to continue to improve the chatbot, Champ. Specifically, I look to add a GUI and add sophistication to Champ's responses back to the user. Maybe I will integrate an openai API to help. Additionally, I want to learn more about speech to text NLP. NLP is a rapidly evolving field. Therefore, the best way to keep pace is to work on more projects and staying up to date with new advancements in this field. 

I am an aspiring Data Scientist, and I hope I can learn more about this field by continuing to work on various projects and taking more courses like this one. In this portfolio, you can also notice my interest in sports analytics (Go Mavs! #mffl)
