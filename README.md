This is a portfolio for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. It showcases the projects done throughout the semester.

## **A bit about myself**
My name is Shreya Valaboju. I am a graduating senior at the University of Texas at Dallas.This past semester, I decided to take the course, "Human Language Technolgies," which is fancy name for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Through various internships and projects, I have a good amount of experience with machine learning. I've made NLP models before, but I wanted to dig deeper into the concepts. For example, I used tf-idf vectorizing before, nevertheless I didn't really understand how it was implemented. 

I am an aspiring Data Scientist, and I hope I can learn more about this field by continuing to work on various projects and taking more courses like this one. In this portfolio, you can also notice my interest in sports analytics (Go Mavs! #mffl)
