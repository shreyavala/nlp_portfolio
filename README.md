Portfolio for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. Showcases the projects done throughout the semester.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 0: Overview of NLP
A report that provides a brief overview of NLP and why I am interested in this field. 


*Read the [report here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 1: NLP Preprocessing
This program implements basic preprocessing to an input text file. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate common preprocessing techniques used in NLP projects, such as capitalization and standardization of phone numbers and ids to a specific format. Additionally, user input is used to correct invalid/incorrectly formatted text. File pickling is also showcased in this project. 

*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 1](Portfolio1) containing the code, an overview document with execution instructions, and data used in this project*

*[Code](Portfolio1/main.py)*

*[Data](Portfolio1/data/data.csv)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 2: Word Guessing Game
This program's purpose is to showcase some basic functionality of the popular NLP library, nltk. After 
preprocessing a raw input text file, an interactive guessing game is implemented for a user to play. 
Follow the readme for this project for instructions on how to play the guessing game and more information
in the links below. 


*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 2](Portfolio2) containing the code, an overview document with execution instructions, and data used in this project*

### Project 3: Exploring WordNet
WordNet is a powerful tool in NLP. The purpose of this notebook is to introduce WordNet using nltk. 
The notebook covers concepts such as synsets, how nouns and verbs are organized, senti-synsets, collocations, and similairty metrics used in WordNet.

*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 3](Portfolio3) containing the notebook and an overview document with execution instructions*
