Portfolio for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. Showcases the projects done throughout the semester.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project 0: Overview of NLP
A report that provides a brief overview of NLP and why I am interested in this field. 


*Read the [report here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf)*

### Project 1: NLP Preprocessing
This program reads in a csv containing information about employees, such as their name, id, and phone number.
The purpose of this program is to implement basic preprocessing functionality (as you would in NLP projects) and gain familiarity with programming in python. Those preprocessing methods include capitalization and standardization of phone numbers and ids to a specific format. If any field for an employee is invalid, preprocessing is done or the user is given a chance to correct that field, and then their information finally saved into a dictionary. At the end, the dictionary is fed into a pickle file. The pickle file is then read and each employee's information is printed.

*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 1](Portfolio1) containing the code, an overview document with execution instructions, and data used in this project*

### Project 3: Word Guessing Game
This program's purpose is to showcase some basic functionality of the popular NLP library, nltk. After 
preprocessing a raw input text file, an interactive guessing game is implemented for a user to play. 
Follow the readme for this project for instructions on how to play the guessing game and more information
in the links below. 


*Here is the folder, [Portfolio 2](Portfolio2) containing the code, an overview document with execution instructions, and data used in this project*
