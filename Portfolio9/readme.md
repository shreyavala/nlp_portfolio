# NBA-Chatbot
A chatbot to query information about NBA players, written by SV and SM. Ask it anything about the Mavericks and its roster of players!

## What This Is
This is Champ, a bot and representation of the mascot of the Mavs, who is here to provide information about the best basketball team in the world. A one-stop-shop that can dynamically process queries from users, it will also make a profile for new users and store their likes/dislikes, which can be updated each time the bot starts up. 

## How to Use
Simply run the program as-is. Once logged in with likes/dislikes, you can ask Champ anything or something specific about a player from the 2022/2023 Roster. This includes:
	
0. Justin Holiday	
1. Theo Pinson	
2. Kyrie Irving	
3. Jaden Hardy	
7. Dwight Powell	
8. Josh Green	
11. Tim Hardaway Jr.	
13. Markieff Morris	
21. Frank Ntilikina	
25. Reggie Bullock	
35. Christian Wood	
42. Maxi Kleber	
44. Davis Bertans	
77. Luka Doncic	
00. Javale McGee

You can ask Champ things like: 	
 'What is Kyrie Irving's height?' 	
 'tell me about Luka Doncic's NBA draft' 	
 'Where did Javale go to college?'

and more! Keep an eye peeled for easter eggs ðŸ˜‰

Until then, go Mavs!
